      <p className='font-semibold'>I was destined for a career on the web ever since a long-lost pal gave me a totally legitimate copy of Adobe Photoshop 7.0 as we waited for the bus to school one morning in 2004. From there I followed what seems to be a well-trodden path, starting out making forum signatures and wallpapers, and following a vast array of online tutorials.</p>

      <p>A year later I was on the official web team for my football club (Hereford United, now defunct üòî), which at 15 years old I thought was the coolest thing in the world. So now I was designing 2005 style website graphics (you know, like rounded corners!) and a natural progression to Dreamweaver&apos;s WYSIWYG website editor soon followed. <a onClick={readMore} className={`gradient-text border-b border-transparent hover:border-pink ${moreActive && 'hidden'}`} href="#">Read More</a></p>

          <h3 className='mt-6 font-primary text-2xl'>üë®‚Äçüíª Career Path</h3>

          <p>My inevitable foray into the code editor was the next step, in which I wrote my first websites using <em>frames</em>... before confidently declaring that table layouts were actually the future. Thankfully, I soon discovered CSS via an astute purchase: <cite>HTML and CSS for Dummies</cite> (funnily enough published by Wiley who would later go on to publish my own book on advanced CSS!).</p>

          <h4 className='font-primary mt-2'>üë®‚Äçüéì My First Roles</h4>

          <p>I landed my first junior role in the industry at 19 at Nottingham marketing agency Adtrak, just after my 2nd year of Uni, working part-time during my final year. After 3 years, my now wife and I then headed to New Zealand for a year for a bit of adventure; we spent a couple of months travelling the whole country in a 20 year old camper, but before that we also got a flat and career relevant jobs in Auckland. I landed my first senior position and embarked on a very productive 10 months, completely transforming the practices of a small web design agency to more modern standards.</p>

          <h4 className='font-primary mt-2'>‚úàÔ∏è Coming Full Circle</h4>
          
          <p>Back in the UK we lived in South Wales for a short stint where I took on another senior UI/front-end role at small agency WebBox Digital, before we eventually decided to move back to Nottingham. And that&apos;s where my career came full circle as I headed back to Adtrak! There&apos;s a special culture at Adtrak, which is why I spent over a decade of my career there, and made what I hope will be some lifelong friends in the process.</p>

          <h4 className='font-primary mt-2'>üí´ Next Steps and Beyond</h4>

          <p>As of January 2025, I&apos;m excited to embark on a new venture as a Senior Front-end Engineer at Intercom! After initially starting out in the industry as very much a hybrid designer/developer, my career has increasingly leaned towards development, and a purely engineering role feels a natural next step for me.</p>

          <p>Generally speaking, my current area of focus is Next.js, Astro, React, JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as a keen interest in the latest, cutting edge features in CSS. But having been building websites since the mid 2000s, I also have a strong knowledge of the core web fundamentals that these new tools ultimately compile down to. Semantic HTML, vanilla JavaScript, an encyclopedic knowledge of CSS, servers, DNS, SEO, page speed... I think the importance of this foundational knowledge can be too easily overlooked today as we lose sight of what actually gets shipped to the browser.</p>

          <h3 className='mt-6 font-primary text-2xl'>üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ Personal Life</h3>

          <p>Away from the screen I have an amazing little family; two sons Leo and Olly, and wife Hannah. Being a Dad has its challenges but it&apos;s also the most rewarding thing I can imagine. Those boys are everything to me and I&apos;d do absolutely anything to make sure they&apos;re happy!</p>

          <h4 className='font-primary mt-2'>‚öΩ Sports</h4>

          <p>I&apos;m a big sports fan; football, tennis, snooker, rugby to name a few. As mentioned I was a big Hereford United fan until they sadly went under in 2014, and I now have a complicated relationship with the phoenix club Hereford FC whose results I loosely follow. The most passionate you&apos;ll see me these days is when supporting the Wales national team, the country of my birth and where much of my family reside.</p>

          <h4 className='font-primary mt-2'>üéß Music</h4>

          <p>I&apos;m also a big music lover with an extremely varied taste. I like real fast-paced punk with a rawness and an edge to it, and I like soft acoustic with a thoughtful slowness (and much in-between). My go-to genres are probably punk, indie rock and ska/reggae, but the list could go on and on. A couple of my favourites in recent years are Soft Play (modern punk) and Sticky Fingers (indie with a light ska influence).</p>

          <p>My music listening habits have been tracked for almost 20 years over on <a className='text-pink hover:underline font-medium' href="https://www.last.fm/user/welshbull" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>, which reports an average of 34 tracks per day in that time, and where I&apos;m stuck with a username that was very evidently created by a 14 year old.</p>

          <h4 className='font-primary mt-2'>‚ö° Motivators</h4>

          <p>In terms of what makes me tick, I love challenges and problem solving. If I can turn something into a challenge it unlocks a real drive and determinedness within, no matter how trivial. Whether it be completing X amount of tasks in a week, watching Y amount of films in a month or running Z amount of miles in a year. This strategy is basically how I keep my life on track and moving forward!</p>
          
          <p>Most who know me know I&apos;m very content with my own company, but I&apos;m a big fan of a social gathering too, particularly when it involves a pub or two! I&apos;m also a fairly opinionated liberal who sometimes gets a bit too disheartened with the current effectiveness of divisive politics.</p>

          <p>And that&apos;s enough waffle for now... I tend to get a bit carried away when I start writing! Feel free to drop me an <a className='text-pink hover:underline font-medium' href="mailto:hi@ste.digital">email</a> or a follow over on the <a className='text-pink hover:underline font-medium' href="https://twitter.com/Ste_Greig" target="_blank">bird app</a> (it&apos;s still Twitter to me damn it!).</p>
